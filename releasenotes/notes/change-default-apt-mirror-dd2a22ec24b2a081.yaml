issues:
  - For OpenStack-Ansible Mitaka releases earlier than 13.3.1 the default
    container apt source used was ``http://mirror.rackspace.com/ubuntu``. This
    mirror seems to sometimes have broken package indexes or missing packages.
    The default package source has therefore been changed to make use of
    ``http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/`` for packages and
    ``http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu`` for security packages.
upgrade:
  - The default container apt sources have been changed from using
    ``http://mirror.rackspace.com/ubuntu`` to
    ``http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/`` for packages and
    ``http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu`` for security packages. This is to
    resolve issues with unavailable packages during the install process due
    to incomplete mirror updates.
